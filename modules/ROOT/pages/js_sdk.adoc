= Hello TurtleQueue in JS

image:undraw_developer_activity_bv83.png[JS developer,250,250,align="center",title-align=center]

This tutorial explains how to get started with TurtleQueue in Node.js and/or in the browser.

In a hurry? Just clone the demo project which contains the final result:
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/turtlequeue/quickstart-js
----

Otherwise follow this guide, which will guide you through sending messages in #channels as well as geolocalized.

== A bit of boilerplate

First, import the library:

[source,js]
----
const turtlequeue = require('turtlequeue');
const websocket = require('websocket') // <1>
----
<1> The library import for the websocket package is only required on nodeJS


We then read the environment variables from the environment (adapt to your build process in the browser). These credentials can be found on your dashboard: https://turtlequeue.com/security.html

[source,js]
----

const USER_TOKEN = process.env.TURTLEQUEUE_USER_TOKEN // <1>
const API_KEY = process.env.TURTLEQUEUE_API_KEY       // <2>

if (!USER_TOKEN) {
  console.log('Missing USER_TOKEN')              // <3>
}

if (!API_KEY) {
  console.log('Missing API_KEY')                 // <4>
}
----
<1> a `UserToken` uniquely identifies an account
<2> an `apiKey` contains the necessary permissions for publishing and subscribing.
<3> if you see this message you need to "export USER_TOKEN=XXX" where "XXX" is the secret value from https://turtlequeue.com/security.html
<4> if you see this message you need to "export API_KEY=XXX" where "XXX" is the secret value from https://turtlequeue.com/security.html


Time to instantiate a new turtlequeue instance.

[source,js]
----
const q = turtlequeue({
  host: 'turtlequeue.com',   // <1>
  type: 'ws',                // <2>
  protocol: 'https',         // <3>
})
----
<1> This is only useful for when turtlequeue is deployed in hosted environments
<2> Only 'ws' (websockets, the default) is supported for now
<3> always prefer 'https' - this is useful in hosted environments

We now have `q` holding an instance that will be able to connect.
No HTTP or WebSocket connection has been opened up yet, we need to explicitly trigger it.


So, let's set up listeners to the various connection events. While not strictly necessary, it is a good practice and can help speed up debugging down the line.

[source,js]
----
q.on('ready', () => {             // <1>
   console.log('TurtleQueue ready')

   setTimeout(publish, 2000)      // <2>
    subscribe()                    // <3>
})

turtlequeue.on('error', evt => {
  console.log('error')
})

turtlequeue.on('disconnect', evt => {
  console.log('Disconnected')
})
----
<1> the 'ready' event is fired when turtlequeue.com is reachable and the authentication is correct
<2> continuously publish every 2 seconds
<3> subscribe, need to do it only once. The callback will be fired every 2.5 seconds

Finally, we now connect!

[source,js]
----
q.connect({ // <1>
  userToken: USER_TOKEN,
  apiKey: API_KEY,
})
console.log('Connecting...')


setTimeout(() => { // <2>
  console.log('Disconnecting!')
  turtlequeue.disconnect()
}, 15000)

----
<1> we connect to the server, using our credentials. If the credentials are correct, the 'ready' event will be fired. Otherwise, the 'error' event will be fired.
<2> after 15 seconds running, we trigger a disconnect. Once done, the `disconnect`event will be triggered

We are now connected and ready to go! The connection count on the dashboard should also increasem as a confirmation that you are connected!

//
// TODO send messages from the dashboard
//
// TODO SHOW A LIVE COUNT OF THE CONNECTIONS ON THE DASHBOARD
// First, let's define two helper functions.
// Publish is the first, it will use `g` to publish a few

// [source,js]
// ----
// const publish = function publish() {
//   console.log('Publishing!')

//   g.publish(
//     {
//       payload: {
//         msg: 'hello turtlequeue'                           // <1>
//       },
//       channel: '#tutorial',                          // <2>
//       location: {                                    // <3>
//         lon: 2.1204,
//         lat: 48.8049
//       },
//     },
//     (err, data) => {                    // <4>
//       console.log('published', err, data)
//     },
//   )
// }
// ----
// <1> the "payload" is a JSON containing arbitrary data. It will be delivered as-is to the consumers
// <2> the #channel you want to publish to. You can think of this as a chat room, or a twitter #hashtag. There are more elaborate ways of communicating, refer to the chapter on link:channel.adoc[channels (@sub, #channel and regex matching)]
// <3> (optional) the location around which you want to publish. In this case the coordinates are Versailles, a French city near Paris
// <4> we generally follow this pattern in callbacks. A third argument `metadata` is also passed which contains


// We now have a function to send data, we need the corresponding function to receive it on the other end!

// [source,js]
// ----

// const subscribe = function subscribe() {
//   return g.subscribe(
//     {
//       channel: '#tutorial', // <1>
//       location: {               // <2>
//         radius: '50km',
//         lon: 2.3522,
//         lat: 48.8566
//       },
//     },
//     (err, data, metadata) => { // <3>
//       console.log('data received in Paris#test', err, data, metadata)
//     },
//   )
// }

// ----
// <1> the same channel as above. If they don't match, we will not receive messages
// <2> The location. This time, the coordinates correspond to Paris, which is less than 50km from Versailles
// <3> the "data" argument will contain the message above `{msg: 'hello turtlequeue'}`



// === Conventions

// This is a convention that most callbacks follow: `(error, data, extra)`.
// Most of the time checking for `(error, data)` is enough, but If you find yourself thinking "I wish turtlequeue exposed more data", it is worth looking at the third `extra` argument.
// If this argument does not contain what you are looking for, feel free to open an issue!

// All this is already available in a sample repository - feel free to clone it - it has tests, a permissive licence, it runs on NodeJs and on the browser with web pack! https://github.com/turtlequeue/quickstart-js[js-sample]
