= Reliability


== Acknowledgements

When sending a message, you want guarantees that it will arrive to it's destination.
The only way to be certain that the message arrived, is to have an acknowledgement sent from the recipient.

Acknowledgement is a built-in feature in TurtleQueue's SDK. For ease of use we automatically acknowledge the messages once your callback has been run, but you can control it manually yourself.

There are two steps to do so:

1. turn off `autoAck`

2. call the acknoledge manually for every message

3. (optional) adjust the acknowledge timeout


If after sending a message to a recipient we do not get an acknowledgement response withing the alloted timeout, the message will be sent again for delivery, until it is finally acknowledged.

When the tradeof is between reliability and performance we will always choose reliability by default. This means that your commands are always persisted, not just kept in-memory before we acknowledge a message to be sent.
