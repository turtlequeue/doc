== Behind the scenes

TurtleQueue network infrastructure is comprised of several parts, all playing an essential part for our customers:

- security policies (login, tokens, limits) are enforced at the edge of the platform

- a user management platform, to securely store your preferences and credentials

- a robust routing engine ensures messages are sent to the right destination

- a durable messaging layer: once the routing engine has decided to send messages, the messaging layer ensures it will be delivered, handles retries and durability

- client SDKs in several languages, communicating with the above layers

- finally, your whole infrastructure is built on Kubernetes, using a multi-cloud cluster for maximum resilience

== Tech

Some of the tech we use and love:

- Node.js / TypeScript
- Clojure
- Kubernetes
- Apache Pulsar
- PostgreSQL

I am in no way affiliated with any of the above products, however nothing would have been possible without these. Kudos!

== No evil corp

No description of a product would be complete without talking about the people behind it.
